## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Bruno

### About me
I'm a software developer specialized in iOS app development. With 2 years of Apple Developer Academy and +3 years of professional experience working with Swift, I have on my belt some nice tools for iOS developemt like View Code, Tuist, CI/CD with Github Actions and Fastlane and currently I'm learning SwiftUI and Combine.

### Working experiences
I started my journey at Popcode Solutions where I've worked on Banese app with maintenance and building new features. But my colaboration with Popcode was brief, with 3 months I received the invite to join Will Bank team.

At Will Bank I developed my skills in iOS development, I worked with great people and stayed there for 3 years and there I participated at great projects with Fraud Prevention's team like face validation and with the Mobile Platform's team wich most remarkable project was the migration from Bitbucket + Bitrise to Github + Github Actions. 

### My tech skills
I like to learn about code quality and software architecture in order to improve the quality of my code and solutions. Besides Swift I can code with Javascript and I love to learn new languages and technologies as you can see in my chart:
